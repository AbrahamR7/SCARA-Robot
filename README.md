### SCARA-Robot

##### Introduction

In this project, we had a mission to work with Robot Epson SCARA T3 and we supposed to develop MATLAB scripts and functions to study the kinematic and dynamic behaviour of this robot and perform two specific tasks. Epson SCARA T3 is A powerful four-axis robot with integrated controller and diverse connection possibilities, capable of payloads up to 3kg and a standard cycle time of 0.54 seconds. The Epson T3 series also supports image-processing, integration of external software and the option to design a custom user interface. It is used to manufacture various automotive parts including brakes, clutch components, ignition systems, instrument panels, headlights, mirrors, locks and more.

##### Requests
In task1 we supposed to Write the group’s letter (N) on a plane (XY) inscribed into a circle of diameter 150 mm using the “lines and parabula” method for trajectory planning. The movement should start from the home position outside the 150 mm diameter circle.

In task2 we have mission to Execute a pick and place task: start from home position (P0), reach pick position (P1), pick the object A and place A in position (P2); move to P3 the EE, pick object B and place this object in P4. Object B is placed on top on A. Return to the home position. Use the lines and parabula method for trajectory planning.
